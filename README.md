Introducing my QR Code Generator App, a project I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by API calls. This has been an exciting journey of coding and creativity, resulting in a dynamic tool to generate QR codes seamlessly. 💻

📲 With this app, users can easily generate QR codes for various purposes like URLs, contact information, and more. It's been an incredible experience integrating APIs to bring real-time functionality to the app, expanding my knowledge of front-end technologies.

🤝 I invite all of you to experience the app and share your valuable feedback. Your support, likes, comments, and endorsements mean the world to me and inspire me to push further in my web development journey! 🙏
