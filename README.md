Introducing my Dictionary App, a project I crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by API calls. This journey has been an incredible learning experience, as I combined my coding skills to create a dynamic and user-friendly dictionary tool. ðŸ’»

ðŸ“š With this app, I've built a seamless and interactive platform where users can explore word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and even hear pronunciations. It's been a fantastic challenge that allowed me to enhance my knowledge of front-end technologies and integrate APIs to fetch real-time data.
